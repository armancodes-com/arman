## Known Security Issues

### Elliptic Cryptographic Vulnerability (Low Severity)

**Status**: Accepted Risk - Development Dependencies Only

**CVE**: CVE-2025-21785  
**GHSA**: [GHSA-848j-6mx2-7j84](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-848j-6mx2-7j84)  
**Severity**: Low (CVSS 5.6)  
**Affected Package**: `elliptic` <= 6.6.1  
**Patched Version**: None available

#### Issue Description

The ECDSA implementation in the `elliptic` package generates incorrect signatures when an interim value of 'k' (computed per RFC 6979) has leading zeros. This can potentially lead to secret key exposure under specific conditions where an attacker obtains both a faulty signature from a vulnerable version and a correct signature for the same inputs.

#### Dependency Chain

```
@storybook/nextjs@10.2.3 (dev dependency)
└── node-polyfill-webpack-plugin@4.1.0
    └── node-stdlib-browser@1.3.1
        └── crypto-browserify@3.12.1
            ├── browserify-sign@4.2.5
            │   └── elliptic@6.6.1
            └── create-ecdh@4.0.4
                └── elliptic@6.6.1
```

#### Risk Assessment

This vulnerability is considered **accepted risk** for the following reasons:

1. **Development-Only Impact**: The vulnerability exists only in Storybook, which is a development tool and is never deployed to production.

2. **No Production Code**: The production application does not use or bundle this dependency. Storybook is listed in `devDependencies` and is only used during development.

3. **Low Severity**: The vulnerability is rated as low severity (CVSS 5.6) with high attack complexity.

4. **Specific Exploit Conditions**: Successful exploitation requires:
   - Access to both a faulty signature generated by the vulnerable version
   - Access to a correct signature for the same inputs
   - Specific cryptographic analysis expertise

5. **No Patched Version**: As of the time of this documentation, there is no patched version of the `elliptic` package available (latest version 6.6.1 is still vulnerable).

6. **Transitive Dependency**: The dependency is deeply nested and not directly controllable without major breaking changes to Storybook.

#### Mitigation Steps Taken

1. **Dependency Pinning**: Using npm overrides to ensure the latest version of `node-polyfill-webpack-plugin` (4.1.0) is used, reducing the attack surface where possible.

2. **Documentation**: This security policy documents the known issue and the rationale for accepting this risk.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of security advisories for updates to the `elliptic` package or alternative solutions from Storybook maintainers.

#### Future Actions

- Monitor for patches to the `elliptic` package
- Monitor for Storybook updates that may use alternative cryptographic libraries
- Re-evaluate this decision if the severity is upgraded or if the vulnerability affects production dependencies

## Reporting a Vulnerability
