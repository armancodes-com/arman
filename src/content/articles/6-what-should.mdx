## What is the design pattern?

- Less time thinking of funky names <sup>1</sup>

- Reduce the size of your CSS files <sup>2</sup>

- Editing already existing styles feels safer <sup>3</sup>

<div className="text-gray-2 text-sm mt-8">
    1 - Tailwind helps you save time and effort by eliminating the need to create unique class names for every element in your UI. You no longer have to struggle to come up with abstract or irrelevant names such as "sidebar-inner-wrapper" or "content-container".

    2 - making it easier to manage and maintain. Unlike traditional CSS, where you need to create new stylesheets for every new feature, Tailwind's utility classes can be easily reused throughout your project, significantly reducing the need to write new CSS code.

    3 - because classes are local to the HTML elements. With global CSS, any change you make can have unforeseen consequences elsewhere in your project, but with Tailwind, you can make changes with confidence, knowing that you won't accidentally break anything.

</div>

### The Power of Reusable Components

One of the key advantages of Tailwind CSS is its promotion of reusable components. Which is now a standard in the front-end world. By using pre-defined classes, Tailwind allows developers to create reusable components that can be easily used throughout the codebase.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const WeatherList = () => {
  return (
    <div className="my-8 flex flex-col gap-2">
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <CityCard key={index} data={item} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

We have [contributors](https://github.com/BrianRuizy/covid19-dashboard/graphs/contributors) from all over the world ––Spain, Poland, India, and various places in the USA–– who came together to create something useful and meaningful. Furthermore, the site has accumulated over 10k visits as shown by web analytics. And, the project is still being maintained and improved upon, thanks to the help of developers.

## Data Sources

A large portion of the data comes from one of the original data repositories tracking COVID-19 cases, [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) CSSE2019-ncov data repository. Additional data was collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) GitHub data repository. Lastly, to fill in some requirements we retrieved data for daily cases from [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) COVID GitHub data repository.

For this project, it was crucial to have accurate, and trustworthy datasets.
This explains why the multiple aforementioned sources were diligently picked.
In doing so the goal is to provide the most accurate representations of the pandemic, the opposite could have its own repercussions at scale.

### 1. Web scraping with Pandas 🐼

Here we defined a simple function that reads from a specific URL that contains a CSV of raw data, we convert it to a Pandas data frame and return it.

```python showLineNumbers {5}
import pandas as pd

def confirmed_report():
  # Returns time series version of total cases confirmed globally
  df = pd.read_csv('https://raw...CSSEGISandData/...csv')
  return df
```

Continuing with the weather theme here, let's create a reusable card component that can be used to display the current weather for a list of cities. With Tailwind, you can style your HTML elements without having to write any CSS rules. This can save you a lot of time, especially if you are working on a large project. Then when you need to reuse this, you don't have to go look for the `styles.css` file and copy it to a new location.

```tsx showLineNumbers
export default const CityCard = ({item}) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={`flex justify-between rounded-3xl bg-gradient-to-br text-white p-4 lg:px-8
      ${item.color}
    `}>
      <div>
        <p className="text-xl font-bold">{item.city}</p>
        <p className="text-sm font-medium mb-5 opacity-75">{item.time}</p>
        <p className="text-sm font-medium mt-auto">{item.state}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col justify-between">
        <p className="text-5xl">{item.temperature}°</p>
        <p className="text-sm font-medium mt-auto opacity-75">
          H:{item.temperature + 7}°
          L:{item.temperature - 7}°
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 1. Analyzing mobile telemetry data

Every modern smartphone is equipped with very accurate telemetry systems. For example, the GPS and accelerometer, which we leveraged for location and to track any abrupt movement indicating a pothole on the road.

One of the difficulties with this approach was that logging every high acceleration movement may result in false positives of a road pothole. Below is also a time-series data visualization of the accelerometer data, generated with matplotlib.

```python showLineNumbers {8-11}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('/home/br/Downloads/testdata.csv')
df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df.Time, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S:%f')

columns = [
  'ACCELEROMETER X (m/s²)',
  'ACCELEROMETER Y (m/s²)',
  'ACCELEROMETER Z (m/s²)',
  'Time'
]

df[columns].plot(x='Time')
plt.show()
```

**In software engineering, software design patterns are common solutions for common problems.** Is it a piece of code? Of course, NOT! It could be a description or template which can be used in many different situations to solve a problem.

Some people may ask, “Why should we use them?” the answer is, “Because design patterns are both **optimized and reusable**.

They were generally grouped into three categories:

- [creational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)
- [structural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern)
- [behavioral patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern)

### What is the Decorator design pattern?

To simplify the term Decorator Pattern, we can say **they will allow adding new functionalities to a particular object without applying it to other objects of a class.**

In Wikipedia’s point of view the Decorator pattern:

> Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

In a nutshell, we will be able to add behaviors to an object, dynamically, without affecting other objects’ behavior from the same class.

### PROBLEM

Suppose we have a swimming pool and it has an online site for selling tickets. Putting the entrance ticket aside, we have several services (Massage, VIP area, etc.) that the customer **may or may not want.**

```php title="sample-file.php" showLineNumbers {1-3} caption="this is caption"
class EntranceTicket
{
    public function getCost()
    {
        return 10;
    }
}
echo (new EntranceTicket())->getCost();
// 10
```

Now our customer wants to relax, so he/she needs to buy the massage service.

```php title="service.php" showLineNumbers
class EntranceTicketAndVIPArea
{
    public function getCost()
    {
        return 10 + 20;
    }
}
echo (new EntranceTicketAndVIPArea())->getCost();
// 30
```

You might say, “Everything is working perfectly” well you are right but take a look at this:

```php title="multiply.php" showLineNumbers
class EntranceTicketAndVIPAreaAndMassage
{
    public function getCost()
    {
        return 10 + 20 + 30;
    }
}
echo (new EntranceTicketAndVIPAreaAndMassage())->getCost();
// 60
```

Well, I suppose you already found some problems here. And here are some of them:

- There will be so many compound classes

- We have hard-coded the price of each service

- We cannot possibly extend our services dynamically (We have to change everything manually which won’t follow the Open/Closed principle in SOLID)

### SOLUTION (Decorator Design Pattern)

For the problem above, using the decorator pattern can be good practice. To do so, follow these steps:

1. **Create an interface**

```php
interface SwimmingPool
{
    public function getCost();
}
```

2. **Now all classes must implement that interface**

As we said earlier, we have a basic plan for our swimming pool, which is the entrance ticket, so everyone needs to buy this ticket to be able to purchase other services. Here is our entrance ticket class:

```php showLineNumbers {5}
class EntranceTicket implements SwimmingPool
{
    public function getCost()
    {
        return 10;
    }
}
```

Now for each class **except the main one in our case entrance ticket,** you must do the following steps:

3. **Create a constructor function and inject the interface**

4. **Update the ‘getCost’ method so that the price updates based on the injected object’s price.**

```php
class Massage implements SwimmingPool
{
    protected $swimmingPool;
    public function __construct(SwimmingPool $swimmingPool)
    {
        $this->swimmingPool = $swimmingPool;
    }

    public function getCost()
    {
        return $this->swimmingPool->getCost() + 30;
    }
}
```

Now, this is our final code:

```php
interface SwimmingPool
{
    public function getCost();
}
class EntranceTicket implements SwimmingPool
{
    public function getCost()
    {
        return 10;
    }
}
class Massage implements SwimmingPool
{
    protected $swimmingPool;
    public function __construct(SwimmingPool $swimmingPool)
    {
        $this->swimmingPool = $swimmingPool;
    }

    public function getCost()
    {
        return $this->swimmingPool->getCost() + 30;
    }
}
class VIPArea implements SwimmingPool
{
    protected $swimmingPool;
    public function __construct(SwimmingPool $swimmingPool)
    {
        $this->swimmingPool = $swimmingPool;
    }

    public function getCost()
    {
        return $this->swimmingPool->getCost() + 20;
    }
}
```

So let’s create the objects:

```php
echo (new VIPArea(new EntranceTicket()))->getCost();
// 30
echo (new Massage(new EntranceTicket()))->getCost();
// 40
echo (new VIPArea(new Massage(new EntranceTicket())))->getCost();
// 60
```

As you can see in the code above, **we can add functionalities dynamically to our objects without changing the class.**

### Conclusion

Some of you might ask, ‘’Well, we can use inheritance instead’’ You must be careful with inheritance because you may extend a class in which you don’t need all its functionalities.
